[TEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY SENSOR (DHT22) ESP32 TTGO T8 V1.7] ============================================================

ESP32 pins schema:
    https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81%2Bjpo9-D8L._SX522_.jpg

DHT22 sensor:
    - connect VCC sensor line to "+5" board pin
    - connect GND sensor line to "ground" board pin
    - connect DATA sensor line to board GPIO 4

    DHT22 datasheet that can be helpful:
    https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/DHT22.pdf

Environment prepare:
In your Blynk App project:
    - add "Gauge" widget,
    - bind it to Virtual Pin V3
    - set name "Temperature"
    - set label /pin.##/Â°C
    - set update time=15 sec and assign 0-100 values range to it

    - add "Gauge" widget,
    - bind it to Virtual Pin V4
    - set name "Humidity"
    - set label /pin.##/ %
    - set update time=15 sec and assign 0-100 values range to it


  - Run the App (green triangle in the upper right corner).
  - define SSID and WiFi password that will be used by ESP32 board
  - optionally change HW GPIO pin that will be used by touch button data line
  - define your auth token for current example and run it

This started program will periodically call and execute event handler "read_virtual_pin_handler".
that will try to get data from sensor and write them to related virtual pins.
Within App widget values will be updated each 15 sec.
If during cycle there was error in get data operation  - widget colors will be changed to grey (aka disabled state)
and restored on next successful read sensor data operation.
